# RadmindTfix4APFS (Legacy)
Legacy code, zipped up for archive purposes.

## Description:

Used in conjunction with Radmind.

RadmindTfix4APFS removes resource forks from a filesystem and re-uploads affected Radmind transcripts.

Deploying a transcript that contain resource forks to an APFS filesystem will throw errors - since APFS filesystems do not support resource forks.

No longer in development.
